# Overview
This project focuses on the fundamental aspects of working with MySQL, a popular open-source relational database management system. You'll find scripts for creating databases, defining tables, inserting data, and performing complex queries. The project demonstrates best practices in relational database design and SQL query optimization.

# Database Schema
The repository contains a sample database schema that can be used for various purposes, such as:

User Management: Managing user accounts, roles, and permissions.
Product Catalog: A database structure for an e-commerce site with products, categories, orders, and reviews.
Order Management: Tables for handling orders, shipments, and payments.


# Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/mysql-database-project.git
Install MySQL:

Download and install MySQL from the official website. You can also use MySQL Workbench for an interactive graphical interface.

Access the MySQL server:

Start your MySQL server and connect using:

mysql -u root -p

# Import the sample database:

Execute the SQL scripts provided in the scripts/ folder to create the sample database and tables:

mysql -u root -p < scripts/create_database.sql

# Usage
Creating the Database
The create_database.sql file contains the necessary commands to create the database and tables. Simply run the script using:

mysql -u root -p < scripts/create_database.sql

# Running Queries
Once the database is set up, you can run various queries to interact with the data. For example:

Select all users:

SELECT * FROM users;
Get total sales per product:

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(o.total) AS total_sales
FROM products p
JOIN orders o ON p.product_id = o.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;
You can modify the queries to suit your own data structure or use the provided examples as a starting point.
